# Android-App-for-Text-Recognition (Tfinder!!)
* I have developed an android app that can recognize and detect text from images using Vision API.
Two annotation features that support optical character recognition (OCR):
  1. TEXT_DETECTION detects and extracts text from any image. For example, a photograph might contain a street sign or traffic sign. The JSON includes the entire extracted string, as well as individual words, and their bounding boxes.
  2. DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION also extracts text from an image, but the response is optimized for dense text and documents. The JSON includes page, block, paragraph, word, and break information.

* The app also has the functionality to detect and display real-time data from sensors (i.e., listed below) embedded in the mobile device.

  Sensors:
    Accelerometer,
    Gyroscope,
    Magnetometer,
    Light Sensor,
    Proximity Sensor
  
 #### I have developed the UI from scratch, iterating with different color combinations, button shapes and, font styles. Below are a few screenshots from the app, I haven't included pictures of live measurements from mobile sensors; you can view them in the demo video.
